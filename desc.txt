Primitive Dynamic particle system

This particle system will dynamically adapt to the environment you give it, bouncing off boundries and borders. Draw a wall and particles will have to bounce off it or avoid it somehow. Gravity is the dominating force in this one. Must be seen in motion!

Note: all 'vbblack' (&H000000) pixels force the particles to be blocked
which is how the engine tells where borders are.
